	------------------This is my journey in Code Chef------------------

I started interested in Competitive Programming in 9th September 2019.

I'm Currently studying in Taiwan. I joined my first CPE (Colligiate Programming Examination) in 24/9/2019. 

I got 2 out 7 questions. My ranking was 304. (Yes, I know this no where any good)

Here is The Website: https://cpe.cse.nsysu.edu.tw/cpe/scoreboard

I wasn't happy either my result. So I this time I'll prepare myself way more. 

I'll get to the top 50 in the next CPE test (13/12/2019).
